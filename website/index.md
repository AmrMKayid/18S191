# Introduction to Computational Thinking

Welcome to **MIT 18.S191 aka 6.S083 aka 22.S092**, **Spring 2021** edition!

> Class starts _Wednesday Feb 17th, 1pm EST_. Come to this page to attend live MIT classes open to
the general public. We will be _broadcasting live_ at this site and will answer questions on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z5qnVf8).

\blurb{This is an introductory course on Computational Thinking. We use the [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org) to approach real-world problems in varied areas applying data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling.  In this class you will learn computer science, software, algorithms, applications, and mathematics as an integrated whole.}

We plan to include the following topics:

- Image analysis
- Machine learning
- Dynamics on networks
- Climate modeling
