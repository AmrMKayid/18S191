# Introduction to Computational Thinking

Welcome to **MIT 18.S191 aka 6.S083 aka 22.S092**, **Spring 2021** edition!

\blurb{This is an introductory course on Computational Thinking. We use the [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org) to approach real-world problems in varied areas applying data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling.  In this class you will learn computer science, software, algorithms, applications, and mathematics as an integrated whole.}

Topics include:

- Image analysis
- Particle dynamics and ray tracing
- Network theory
- Climate modeling

- Interactive visualizations
- Exercises

### Live lectures
On **Monday 1:00pm - 2:30pm**, after the material is published, there will also be:
- Q&A on Discord
- Live overview lecture _(30 minutes)_

On **Wednesday 1:00pm 2:30pm** _(MIT students only)_, you will meet with fellow students and your TA to:
- Review the lecture
- Work on problem sets in small groups or individually, with the opportunity to ask questions to your TA

Start date: February 16, 2021


### Discussion forum and homework submission
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z5qnVf8): discussion (we encourage you to hang out here during class!)

- [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kd33x1xnfyq3b1): (MIT only) questions, discussion with staff, announcements

- [Canvas](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/5637): (MIT only) homework submissions. If you're a non-MIT student, don't worry, the **homework has built-in answers checks**, or you can find a partner to cross-grade homeworks via Discord.


### Evaluation

The final grade is 80% problem sets, and 20% MITx _quick questions_.

*   Problem sets are released on Tuesdays and due before Sunday (11:59pm). They have equal weight; your lowest score will be dropped.

*   MITx exercises (_quick questions_) are due before Wednesday (11:59pm), but are best done on Monday, during or right after the lectures.
