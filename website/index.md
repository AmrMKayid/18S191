Welcome to **MIT 18.S191 aka 6.S083 aka 22.S092**, **Spring 2021** edition!

> This is **Spring 2021**. For **Fall 2020**, see our [old website](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall20/).

> This is a **preview** of the new course material. _Come back soon for the first lecture!_

\blurb{This is an introductory course on Computational Thinking. We use the [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org) to approach real-world problems in varied areas applying data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling.  In this class you will learn computer science, software, algorithms, applications, and mathematics as an integrated whole.}

Topics include:

- Image analysis
- Machine Learning?
- Network theory
- Climate modeling
