> We streamed our first live lecture on 1:05pm EST on Wednesday 2/17! You can watch it here ☝️

\blurb{This is an introductory course on Computational Thinking. We use the [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org) to approach real-world problems in varied areas applying data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling.  In this class you will learn computer science, software, algorithms, applications, and mathematics as an integrated whole.}

We plan to include the following topics:

- Image analysis
- Machine learning
- Dynamics on networks
- Climate modeling
