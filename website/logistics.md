-   Exercises

### Live lectures

On **Monday 1:00pm - 2:30pm**, after the material is published, there will also be:

-   Q&A on Discord
-   Live overview lecture _(30 minutes)_

On **Wednesday 1:00pm 2:30pm** _(MIT students only)_, you will meet with fellow students and your TA to:

-   Review the lecture
-   Work on problem sets in small groups or individually, with the opportunity to ask questions to your TA

Start date: February 16, 2021

### Discussion forum and homework submission

-   [Discord](https://discord.gg/BfWAUSrEhD): discussion (we encourage you to hang out here during class!)

-   MIT Only: [Canvas](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/5637): Homework submissions, Piazza Link. If you're a non-MIT student, don't worry, the **homework has built-in answers checks**, or you can find a partner to cross-grade homeworks via Discord.

### Evaluation

The final grade is 80% problem sets, and 20% MITx _quick questions_.

-   Problem sets are released on Tuesdays and due before Sunday (11:59pm). They have equal weight; your lowest score will be dropped.

-   MITx exercises (_quick questions_) are due before Wednesday (11:59pm), but are best done on Monday, during or right after the lectures.
